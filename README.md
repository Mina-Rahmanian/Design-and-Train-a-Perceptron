# Design and train a Perceptron (using iris data)
<br />


Useful bits of knowledge before start:
+ First of all, please read The Artificial Neural Networks book in second edition from this link ["Elements of Artificial Neural Networks" ](https://www.academia.edu/23714658/Elements_of_Artificial_Neural_Networks). 
+ There are absolutely free resources for Deep Learning (online book) in [here](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap1.html).
+  Also if you want to work Convolutional network you can read this link [Convolutional network](https://ujjwalkarn.me/2016/08/11/intuitive-explanation-convnets/)too.
