# Design and train a Perceptron (using iris data)
<br />


Useful bits of knowledge before start:
+ First of all, please read The Artificial Neural Networks book in second edition from this link ["Elements of Artificial Neural Networks" ](https://www.academia.edu/23714658/Elements_of_Artificial_Neural_Networks). 
+ There are absolutely free resources for Deep Learning (online book) in [here](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap1.html).
+  Also if you want to work Convolutional network you can read this link [Convolutional network](https://ujjwalkarn.me/2016/08/11/intuitive-explanation-convnets/) too.

## Data Description

+ Iris data is one of the most popular datasets in machine learning tasks. Iris is a flowering plant with 260-300 different species.
+ Iris data contains the measurements of 3 different species of Iris: Setosa, Versicolour and Virginia.
+ The data is provided in two files here: [ iris_train.txt](https://github.com/Mina-Rahmanian/Design-and-Train-a-Perceptron/blob/main/iris_train.txt) and [iris_test.txt](https://github.com/Mina-Rahmanian/Design-and-Train-a-Perceptron/blob/main/iris_test.txt).
